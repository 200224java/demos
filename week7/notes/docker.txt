Docker is a virtualization technology. Virtualization is the idea of simulating hardware/software.

We have had Virtual Machines for many years. It is a simulation of an entire computer, including OS.
When we want to scale globally, the repeated use of the OS becomes useless wasted hard drive space.

So in order to efficiently scale, we want a more lightweight alternative.

Containers are a lighter virtualization technology than virtual machines.

Docker is a software tool to create and manage these containers.

Containers will NOT have an entire OS (if it is not needed, which is the majority of the time).

Dependencies that we need to run our spring application:
Java 8
