We have previously discussed the ideas of Continuous Integration, Delivery, and Deployment.

A pipeline is a server that allows us to automate all steps for CI/CD/CD.

1. Souce Code Control
2. Building/Testing Automation
3. Deploying to Staging
4. Acceptance Testing
5. Deployment of the Build

Continuous Integration = Automation of Step 1
Continous Delivery = Automation of Steps 1 - 4
Continuous Deployment = Automation of all Steps 1 - 5
