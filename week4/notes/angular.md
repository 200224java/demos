Angular follows the MVC Design Pattern
MVC = Model - View - Controller
Model
  - The data that is being manipulated and passed around
  - In particular, these would be the classes that we define ourselves
View
  - Anything that contributes to what is being seen
  - In particular, this would be the html and css files
Controller
  - The logic that controls the view, and adds/removes the model data to/from the view
  - In particular, this would be the .ts files

We can see that each Angular component follows the MVC design pattern

In future weeks, we will also be implementing the MVC design pattern on our backend, specifically with Spring Framework.
