=====SDLC=====
Software Development LifeCycle
- Process for planning, creating, testing, and displaying information systems

General steps:
1) Requirements Phase: Existing system is evaluated so that the existing
  flaws can be determined
    - Business Analysts (BAs)
2) Analysis Phase: The new system requirements are defined. In particular
  deficiencies are addressed with proposal for improvement.
    - Business Analysts + Senior member of team
3) Design Phase: The proposed system is actually designed. No coding is done yet.
  Product features are planned out.
    - Architects and Senior devs
4) Development Phases: Software is built. Code for the product is actually written
    - Junior & Senior devs, etc
5) Testing Phase: Software is tested to ensure it functions as intended
    - Devs, Testers
6) Deployment and Maintence Phase: Product is delivered/deployed to the customer.
  Maintenance is obviously rigorously kept up.
    - Operations

===Waterfall Method===
- It is a traditional way of following the SDLC
- 1 ->
      2 ->
          3 ->
              4 ->
                  5 ->
                      6
- The idea is that you completely finish one phase of the SDLC before
  moving on to the next
- You do NOT return to any previous phase
- Progress is seen as only going downwards
- Best suited for smaller, short term projects or where project
  requirements do not change (such as Government projects)
- Generally considered not as efficient money-wise
- Cannot go back up the chain
  - Considered inflexible

===Agile===
- Agile is another method for following the SDLC
- An approach to Software development based on iterative development
  where requirements and solutions evolve through the collaboration
  of cross-functional teams
- Agile is a mentality or a philosophy
- Agile is not "a thing that you do", it is a mindset, or
  an approach to software development
- Four core values to Agile (From Agile Manifesto)
  1) Individuals and Interactions over processes and tools
  2) Working software over comprehensive documentation
  3) Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
  4) Responding to change over following a plan
- Agile methods (often called frameworks) are comprehensive approaches to the SDLC
  - "Scrum" is the most common Agile framework
- Agile practices (closely tied to DevOps):
  - Continuous Integration (CI): The idea or process or practice of continuously
    merging multiple developer's code (usually in a repository) *frequently*.
    This should happen multiple times a day. It is meant to prevent large errors
    from accumulating. The sooner you find them, the smaller they will be.
      - Note that this CAN be automated
  - Continuous Delivery (CD): Automated the testing of your code that your code
    and the release process so that you can deploy the application "at the push
    of a button". Generally for a big "release day".
  - Continuous Deployment (CD): Every change that passes all stages of the product
    pipeline is released to the customer immediately. There is no "release day".
    This is particularly valuable because it speeds up feedback from the customer.
