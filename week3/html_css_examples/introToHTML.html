<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--This is how you enclose a comment in HTML-->
<!--
    The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is used by the web browser to
    understand which version of HTML the document is using.
    The current version of HTML is HTML5 and it uses the declaration
    that we see above
    - All html files need to have the doctype declared
    - the doctype is not actually an element of the html tag
    - it lets the browser know how the document should be interpreted
    by indicating what version or standard of html (or other markup
    language) is being used
-->

            Head tags are used to supply meta data regarding the

    <h1>HTML Semantic Tags</h1>
    <!--
        Semantic tags are tags that are named in a specific way
        so that they are easier to read by humans. They help discern
        the intentions of the developer who wrote the html doc.
        -note that they are not different from regular tags, they just
        aim to more clearly communicate the purpose for certain
        segments of html

        Examples: header, footer, nav, article, etc.
    -->
    <header>
        <h1>I am in a header</h1>
        <p>
            Usually, this would be used at the top of the webpage.
        </p>
    </header>
    <!--footers are elements meant to be used as a footer-->
    <footer>
        <h2>this is a footer</h2>
        <p>usually, this would be used at the bottom of the page</p>
    </footer>
    <!--nav is usually used to enclose a section that has links
    ....kind of like for a navbar-->
    <nav>
        <h1>Navigate to these links!!</h1>
        <a href="https://google.com">Google</a><br/>

    <!--Attributes-->
    <!--
        An attribute is used to define the characteristics of an
        html element
        -attributes are placed within the element's opening tag
        -all elements are made up of two parts: a name and a value
        -the name is the property you want to set
        -the value is what you want the property to be set to
    -->
    <p align="left">This is a left aligned tag</p>
    <p align="center">This is a center aligned tag</p>
    <p align="right">This is a right aligned tag</p>
    <h3>Title Attribute</h3>
    <!--
        The title attribute gives a suggested title for the
        element
        -the behavior of this attribute will depend upon the
        element that carries it
        -the example below will create an element that will summon
        a tooltip when the cursor comees into contact withit
    -->
    <h4 title="Hello!!!HTML!!!STUFF!!">H4 tag with title attribute</h4>
    <h1>The ID attribute</h1>
    <!--
        the id attribute of an html tag can be used to uniquely
        identify any element within an html page
        there are two main reasons why you would use an id:
            -if an element carries an id attribute as a unique
            identifier, it is possible to identify just that element
            and its content
            -if you have two elements of the same name within a web page,
            you can distinguish between elements that have the same name
    -->
    <p id="id1">This paragraph talks about html</p>
    <p id="id2">this paragraph attempts to talk aobut css</p>

        The style can be used to add css to that particluar tag
