# Study Guide (Overall Concepts)

For each topic, I suggest you be able to answer these overall questions:
  Tell me about your experience with X.
  What is X?
  How does X work?

Additionally, be able to follow up with more detail as needed.
As well as examples for them.

Make sure you are able to offer specific syntax for each of these topics.

I also suggest reviewing the "How to do well in QC" document that was shared and pinned in the slack workspace (general channel).

Make sure to be continuously practicing your communication style/soft skills as discussed
with me in our interviews, as well as with the PDP team.
Along with Enthuware and Hackerrank practice.
